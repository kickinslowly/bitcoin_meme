This is a learning project to help me understand Flask web framework. 

This app pings coindesk every 30 seconds and grabs current Bitcoin price. Then it displays the Bitcoin Roller Coaster Guy at an angle associated with the % change in price over the last 30 seconds. It also chooses appropriate audio to display with Roller Coaster Guy.

The page isn't beautiful, but the basic idea is working.
